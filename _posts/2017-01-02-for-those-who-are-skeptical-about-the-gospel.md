title: For Those Who are Skeptical About the Gospel
---

We love science, reason and empirical proof. In our western culture we are careful to only trust that which is proven and reasonable. Faith, though acceptable for someone else, is largely seen as a weakness and a crutch.

You are a person of faith. Some believe in a defined faith such as Judaism, Islam, Buddhism or Christianity, while others, such as secularists, agnostics or atheists, hold to an undefined or more informal belief system.

Our views on assault, intolerance, bigotry and beauty show that we truly believe in absolutes and ultimate morals. Each of these absolutes go beyond reason and cross over into the realm of faith, regardless of whether we choose to admit it.

The hope of this booklet is to allow you, as a reasonable person who rests on faith (again, all of us do, ultimately), to have the chance to “hear out” a simple summary of the faith that is found in the Bible. Truthfully, our ultimate hope is that in doing so, you hear the voice of Christ calling you and place your faith in Him.
