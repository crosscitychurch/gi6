title: For Those Who Accept the Gospel
---

God changes people through the gospel. It is the precious foundation for all of our thinking and the most powerful tool we have for accomplishing our mission. We must be gospel-centered people who preach the gospel to ourselves daily and eagerly seek
the opportunities to share it with others.

The gospel is greatly misunderstood and quickly forgotten. One of our greatest obstacles to sharing the gospel is our worldâ€™s impression that they already understand it. The same can be said of the Church. Therefore, our greatest ambitions will always be our own personal understanding, our own belief in the gospel and our own ability to convey that message to the world around us.

The gospel can be explained simply in a few sentences or fully unfolded as the whole 66 books of the Bible. Yet God has given us the freedom and obligation to communicate the gospel in the most effective fashion possible. To accomplish this, our communication
of the gospel needs to meet three standards:

1. It must be Biblically correct and paint a clear story
2. It must establish core concepts, while clearing up common misconceptions
3. It must provide the believer with clear direction for every area of life

As you read through this booklet, consider two things: First, are there areas of your life that suffer from poor understanding, forgetfulness or partial disbelief of the gospel? And secondly, but just as importantly, how would you explain the gospel to the people God has placed in your life?

Take a moment to think through the five questions on the previous page and keep your answers in mind as you work through this booklet.
