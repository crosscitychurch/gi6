    <h2 class="acc-link">For Those Who Are <span class="keyword">Uncertain</span> About the Gospel</h2>
<div class="acc-text">
    <p>Thank you for taking a few moments to consider the message of the Bible, which it calls “The gospel”. The gospel means “Good News”, but its message is actually some very bad news followed by much better news.</p>
    <p>As you read this introduction, you will probably find yourself in one of the following three categories:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You are aware that you don’t understand the gospel</li>
      <li>You may think you have understood the gospel, but actually have not</li>
      <li>Or, you may truly understand the gospel and have chosen to reject it</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Most likely, you belong in one of the first two categories, and the reason is simple. The Bible can be overwhelming and hard to understand. But the message of the Bible doesn’t have to be confusing. God has designed the gospel to be explained in a
      variety of ways, depending upon audience. Jesus Himself gave the gospel to people in different ways, yet it was always the same message, anchored in the same absolute truths. In this little booklet, we will start at the beginning, and give you a
      clear explanation of what the Bible <em>says</em>, and what it <em>means for you.</em></p>
    <p>As you start through the next few pages, start by asking yourself the five following questions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What does the God of the Bible care most about?</li>
      <li>What is God’s main problem with mankind?</li>
      <li>In the concept of salvation... what is God primarily offering mankind?</li>
      <li>Who is Jesus and how does He enable this offer?</li>
      <li>How does a person receive this offer?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If you can answer these questions, then you are well on your way to finally understanding what the Bible is actually saying... and you are ready to consider what you now want to do with it.</p>
  </div>

<h2 class="acc-link">For Those Who are <span class="keyword">Skeptical</span> About the Gospel</h2>
<div class="acc-text">
    <p>We love science, reason and empirical proof. In our western culture we are careful to only trust that which is proven and reasonable. Faith, though acceptable for someone else, is largely seen as a weakness and a crutch.</p>
    <p>You are a person of faith. Some believe in a defined faith such as Judaism, Islam, Buddhism or Christianity, while others, such as secularists, agnostics or atheists, hold to an undefined or more informal belief system.</p>
    <p>Our views on assault, intolerance, bigotry and beauty show that we truly believe in absolutes and ultimate morals. Each of these absolutes go beyond reason and cross over into the realm of faith, regardless of whether we choose to admit it.</p>
    <p>The hope of this booklet is to allow you, as a reasonable person who rests on faith (again, all of us do, ultimately), to have the chance to “hear out” a simple summary of the faith that is found in the Bible. Truthfully, our ultimate hope is that
      in doing so, you hear the voice of Christ calling you and place your faith in Him.</p>
  </div>

<h2 class="acc-link">For Those Who <span class="keyword">Accept</span> the Gospel</h2>
<div class="acc-text">
    <p>God changes people through the gospel. It is the precious foundation for all of our thinking and the most powerful tool we have for accomplishing our mission. We must be gospel-centered people who preach the gospel to ourselves daily and eagerly seek
      the opportunities to share it with others.</p>
    <p>The gospel is greatly misunderstood and quickly forgotten. One of our greatest obstacles to sharing the gospel is our world’s impression that they already understand it. The same can be said of the Church. Therefore, our greatest ambitions will always
      be our own personal understanding, our own belief in the gospel and our own ability to convey that message to the world around us.</p>
    <p>The gospel can be explained simply in a few sentences or fully unfolded as the whole 66 books of the Bible. Yet God has given us the freedom and obligation to communicate the gospel in the most effective fashion possible. To accomplish this, our communication
      of the gospel needs to meet three standards:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>It must be Biblically correct and paint a clear story</li>
      <li>It must establish core concepts, while clearing up common misconceptions</li>
      <li>It must provide the believer with clear direction for every area of life</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As you read through this booklet, consider two things: First, are there areas of your life that suffer from poor understanding, forgetfulness or partial disbelief of the gospel? And secondly, but just as importantly, how would you explain the gospel
      to the people God has placed in your life?</p>
    <p>Take a moment to think through the five questions on the previous page and keep your answers in mind as you work through this booklet.</p>

<p>The only way a person will be reconciled to God through Christ, is by asking God to apply the work of Jesus to transform him from a self- centered rebel, to a God-centered person who loves and obeys Him. Such a repentance and plea for salvation is called
    “being saved by grace through faith”. From that moment on, God reconciles that person to Himself and He becomes their treasure and authority.</p>
