    <p>Thank you for taking a few moments to consider the message of the Bible, which it calls “The gospel”. The gospel means “Good News”, but its message is actually some very bad news followed by much better news.</p>

<p>As you read this introduction, you will probably find yourself in one of the following three categories:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You are aware that you don’t understand the gospel</li>
  <li>You may think you have understood the gospel, but actually have not</li>
  <li>Or, you may truly understand the gospel and have chosen to reject it</li>
</ol>

<p>Most likely, you belong in one of the first two categories, and the reason is simple. The Bible can be overwhelming and hard to understand. But the message of the Bible doesn’t have to be confusing. God has designed the gospel to be explained in a variety of ways, depending upon audience. Jesus Himself gave the gospel to people in different ways, yet it was always the same message, anchored in the same absolute truths. In this little booklet, we will start at the beginning, and give you a clear explanation of what the Bible <em>says</em>, and what it <em>means for you.</em></p>

<p>As you start through the next few pages, start by asking yourself the five following questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What does the God of the Bible care most about?</li>
  <li>What is God’s main problem with mankind?</li>
  <li>In the concept of salvation… what is God primarily offering mankind?</li>
  <li>Who is Jesus and how does He enable this offer?</li>
  <li>How does a person receive this offer?</li>
</ol>

<p>If you can answer these questions, then you are well on your way to finally understanding what the Bible is actually saying… and you are ready to consider what you now want to do with it.</p>
